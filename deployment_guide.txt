GEORGE MARTEN - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE (DEFINITIVE VERSION)
===================================================

THE PERMANENT FIX FOR "UNEXPECTED TOKEN <":
-------------------------------------------
Static hosting (GitHub Pages) cannot handle standard browser imports of files 
containing JSX. By putting everything into 'index.js', we allow Babel 
Standalone to transpile your entire app at once. This is the only way to 
guarantee zero errors without a complex build setup.

PART 1: PREPARING THE FOLDER
----------------------------
Keep ONLY these files in your root folder for a clean push:
1. index.html
2. index.js (This now contains ALL your code)
3. CNAME (containing: georgemarten.net)
4. metadata.json
5. images/ (folder containing profile.jpg, IoR.jpg, etc.)

Note: You can safely delete App.js, index.tsx, and the /pages folder. 
They are now all contained within index.js.

PART 2: PUSHING TO GITHUB
-------------------------
1. Open Terminal in the project folder.
2. Run these exact commands:
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deployment fix: Single-file JS structure"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
   git push -u origin main --force

PART 3: GITHUB PAGES SETTINGS
-----------------------------
1. Settings -> Pages.
2. Build and deployment -> Branch: main, Folder: / (root). Save.
3. Custom domain: georgemarten.net. Save.
4. IMPORTANT: Wait for the DNS check to pass, then check 'Enforce HTTPS'.

PART 4: WHY THIS IS BETTER
--------------------------
- Zero Build Steps: No NPM, no Webpack, no Vite. It works out of the box.
- Fast Updates: Edit index.js, push to GitHub, and your site updates instantly.
- Professional Style: Retains the Neo-gothic aesthetic while ensuring the 
  professional academic layout is always accessible.
