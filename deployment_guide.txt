GEORGE MARTEN - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
================================

PART 1: PUSHING TO GITHUB
-------------------------
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named 'georgemarten.github.io' (or any name you prefer).
2. Open your terminal/command prompt in the root folder of these files.
3. Initialize the repository:
   git init
4. Add all files:
   git add .
5. Commit your changes:
   git commit -m "Initial portfolio launch"
6. Link to your GitHub repo (replace [USERNAME] with your GitHub name):
   git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
7. Push the code:
   git push -u origin main

PART 2: GITHUB PAGES SETTINGS
-----------------------------
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com.
2. Click 'Settings' (top tab) -> 'Pages' (left sidebar).
3. Under 'Build and deployment', ensure 'Source' is set to 'Deploy from a branch'.
4. Select the 'main' branch and folder '/ (root)'. Click 'Save'.
5. Under 'Custom domain', type: georgemarten.net
6. Click 'Save'. It will show 'DNS check successful' once Part 3 is done.

PART 3: ATTACHING THE DOMAIN (DNS SETTINGS)
-------------------------------------------
Log in to your domain registrar (where you rented georgemarten.net) and find the DNS Management / Advanced DNS section. Add the following records:
